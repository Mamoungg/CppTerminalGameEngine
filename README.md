# Minimal C++ Terminal Game Framework

A lightweight, dependency free **terminal game framework** built from scratch using **standard C++ (C++17)**.
This project demonstrates core **game engine fundamentals**, including a real time game loop, entity based engine, collision detection, and non blocking input. All rendered using ASCII graphics in the terminal

## 🎮 Overview

This project implements a small grid-based game where the player navigates a bouded word, interacts with objects, and avoids enemies. Despite its simplicity, the framework mirrors real game engine architecture at a smaller scale.

The goal of the project is **educational**: to understand how game engines work internally without relying on external libraries
